### Note from the future: 
I built this simple application to learn about Android app development. It's here in the Museum of Old Code to show how much I've learned since then.

# Calculate CFM

This is a very simple app for calculating the required CFM of a carburetor for a particular engine. It will ot set the world on fire, nor will it cure cancer, but I learned a lot while I was making it and I'm very happy about that. Hopefully more, better things are in the future. If you just want the app and not the code, you can get it from www.rocketships.ca/CalculateCFM.apk.

If you find any bugs in the code, please let me know, either here or via Facebook (username kluny.ftw), or in the comments of my blog, www.rocketships.ca/blog. I will thank you by "liking", "sharing", "linking" or "upvoting" a thing of your choice on whatever site you're into. Please make sure the thing in question is cool :)
